## regression-analysis
Implementation of KNN, Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gaussian Process for the SARCOS data set in python. 

### Basic Directory

In the basic directory, there are implementations of basic data science techniques. This consists of 3 files, covering the topics of data exploration, decision trees and linear regression. 

Questions are posed and the solutions to these questions are written in the codeblocks.

### Project Directory

The project directory consists four juypter notebook files, which implement the regression methods: KNN, Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gaussian Process.

There is also a file *analysis.pdf* which is an analysis of the various methods on the SARCOS dataset, and on toy problems.

Finally, the SARCOS dataset is included as *sarcos_inv.txt*.
